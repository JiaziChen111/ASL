# ASL: adaptive MCMC for synthetic likelihoods and correlated synthetic likelihoods

This is demonstrative code for the paper by Umberto Picchini, Umberto Simola and Jukka Corander "Adaptive MCMC for synthetic likelihoods and correlated synthetic likelihoods"

- the "astrostats" folder contains code to run the astrostatistics example using ASL with correlated synthetic likelihoods. The uploaded version computes synthetic likelihoods with a regularization of the covariance matrix via shrinkage.
- the "recruitment" foldr contains code to run the recruitment boom and bust example.
